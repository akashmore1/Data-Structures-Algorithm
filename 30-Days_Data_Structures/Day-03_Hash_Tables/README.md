# Hash Tables

1. Hash tables are built in almost every programming language.
2. In JS, we have **objects**. In python, we have **dictionsries**.
3. Hash tables are just key-value pairs.

## Big (O) of operations on a Hash Table

### 1. Access: O(1)

### 2. Insert: O(1)

### 3. Delete: O(1)

**If we want to search a key complexity is O(1), but if we want to search a value then complexity is O(n)**
