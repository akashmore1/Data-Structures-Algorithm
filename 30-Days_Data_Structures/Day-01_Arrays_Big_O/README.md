# Introduction to Data Structures

## What are data structures?

1.  Collection of data values
2.  Realtionships between them
3.  functions and operations that can be applied on them.

For intro refer DSA in JS (Colt Steele)

## Asymptotic notations:

It is nothing but what we ignore in f(n) to find out O(n)
f(n^2 + n + 1) = O(n^2)
