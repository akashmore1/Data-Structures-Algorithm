# Problem Solving Patterns

### Some Problem Solving Patterns

1. Frequency Counter
2. Multiple Pointers
3. Sliding Window
4. Divide and Conquer
5. Dynamic Programming
6. Greedy Algorithms
7. Backtracking

## Frequency Counter

1. This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
2. This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays / strings

## Multiple Pointer Pattern

1. Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition.
2. Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well.
