# Problem Solving Patterns

### Some Problem Solving Patterns

1. Frequency Counter
2. Multiple Pointers
3. Sliding Window
4. Divide and Conquer
5. Dynamic Programming
6. Greedy Algorithms
7. Backtracking

## Frequency Counter

1. This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
2. This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays / strings
