# Graphs

1. A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.
2. Nodes + Connections

## USES FOR GRAPHS

1. Social Networks
2. Location / Mapping
3. Routing Algorithms
4. Visual Hierarchy
5. File System Optimizations
6. EVERYWHERE!

## ESSENTIAL GRAPH TERMS

1. Vertex - a node
2. Edge - connection between nodes
3. Weighted/Unweighted - values assigned to distances between vertices
4. Directed/Undirected - directions assigned to distanced between vertices
