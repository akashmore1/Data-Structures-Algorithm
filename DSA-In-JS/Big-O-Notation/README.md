# Big O Notation

1. When a problem has muliple solution, to find which solution is better, we use Big O notation.
2. It's important to have a precise vocabulary to talk about how our code performs.
3. When your code slows down or crashes, identifying parts of the code that are inefficient can help us find pain points in our applications.
