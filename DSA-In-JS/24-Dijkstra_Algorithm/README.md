# Dijkstra's Algorithm

## OBJECTIVES

1. Understand the importance of Dijkstra's
2. Implement a Weighted Graph
3. Walk through the steps of Dijkstra's
4. Implement Dijkstra's using a naive priority queue
5. Implement Dijkstra's using a binary heap priority queue

## WHY IS IT USEFUL?

1. GPS - finding fastest route
2. Network Routing - finds open shortest path for data
3. Biology - used to model the spread of viruses among humans
4. Airline tickets - finding cheapest route to your destination
5. Many other uses!
