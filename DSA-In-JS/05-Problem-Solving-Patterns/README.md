# Problem Solving Patterns

### Some Problem Solving Patterns

1. Frequency Counter
2. Multiple Pointers
3. Sliding Window
4. Divide and Conquer
5. Dynamic Programming
6. Greedy Algorithms
7. Backtracking

## Frequency Counter

1. This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
2. This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays / strings

## Multiple Pointer Pattern

1. Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition.
2. Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well.

## Sliding Window Pattern

1. This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another.
2. Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created).
3. Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.

## Divide and Conquer

1. This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data.
2. This pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity.
